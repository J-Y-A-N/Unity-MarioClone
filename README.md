# Unity-MarioClone

# This is a Unity project that makes a simple Mario-like 2D computer game. Users can use arrow keys to control Mario and space to jump. The game also has collision systems for enemy and question blocks. If Mario hits a question block from the bottom, a coin will be collected. If Mario hits an enemy from the top, the enemy will disappear. If an enemy hits Mario, however, Mario will die and the game will switch to GameOver scene. The game will end when Mario reaches the right end of the map and enters the castle. 

# To use this project, please import the MarioClone folder to a new Unity project and build the project locally.
